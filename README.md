Data Scientist | Healthcare Analytics | Machine Learning

I recently completed a Master’s in Data Science with a healthcare concentration.
My work focuses on machine learning applications, statistical analysis, and data
visualization to real-world problems.

## Projects

### Fake vs Real Job Postings (NLP)
This project addresses the growing problem of fraudulent job postings by building machine learning models capable of distinguishing real vs scam listings using textual and behavioral patterns. I developed an end-to-end NLP pipeline combining TF-IDF + linear models, BERT, GPT-2 synthetic data augmentation, and a stacking ensemble. The dataset contained extreme class imbalance (~5% fraud), requiring careful mitigation strategies. The final model was evaluated on both Kaggle data and an external USAJOBS dataset to assess real-world generalization.

### Diabetes Prediction (Machine Learning)
Built and evaluated classification models to predict diabetes outcomes using
clinical features, focusing on performance metrics and model comparison.
