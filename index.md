Data Scientist | Healthcare Analytics | Machine Learning

I recently completed a Master’s in Data Science with a concentration in healthcare analytics. My work focuses on building practical machine learning solutions for real-world problems, with experience in NLP, classification modeling, class imbalance handling, and data-driven decision support.

I am particularly interested in projects involving messy, high-impact data where model performance, interpretability, and robustness matter.

## Projects

### Fake vs Real Job Postings — NLP Capstone

#### Fraud Detection | NLP | BERT | GPT-2 Augmentation | Ensemble Learning

This project addresses the growing problem of fraudulent job postings by building machine learning models capable of distinguishing real vs scam listings using textual and behavioral patterns.

I developed an end-to-end NLP pipeline combining:
* TF-IDF + linear models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes)
* Transformer-based modeling with BERT
* Prompt-based GPT-2 synthetic data generation to mitigate extreme class imbalance (~5% fraud)
* A stacking ensemble classifier to improve robustness 

The final models were evaluated on both Kaggle data and an external USAJOBS dataset to assess real-world generalization and false positive behavior.

#### Key skills demonstrated:
NLP preprocessing, class imbalance mitigation, transformer modeling, ensemble learning, error analysis, external validation

### Diabetes Prediction (Machine Learning)

Healthcare Analytics | Classification | Model Evaluation

Built and evaluated multiple classification models to predict diabetes outcomes using clinical features. This project focused on feature analysis, model comparison, and performance evaluation in a healthcare context.

#### Key skills demonstrated:
Supervised learning, feature engineering, model evaluation, healthcare data analysis
